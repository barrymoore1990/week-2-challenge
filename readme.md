# Portfolio Challenge

## Description

The portfolio was created to showcase my current portfolio of development work. The problem it solves is that I need a place to showcase my work in case anyone is interested in working with me, so there's a central hub of my work that they can explore.

I learned a huge amount as most of the parts of the website I had enough, but limited, knowledge on how to do. Putting all of this into practice really helped my knowledge on each part and has proven to me I can use HTML and CSS to create good looking, responsive, websites, that follow standard practices. Something that I couldn't do before the course started.
